We partner with our customers to create the products that build a better world. Since 1979, Plexus has been partnering with companies to transform concepts into branded products and deliver them to the market. From idea to aftermarket and everything in between, Plexus is a global leader in providing support for all the facets of the product realization process - Design and Development, Supply Chain Solutions, New Product Introduction, Manufacturing, and Aftermarket Services. Plexus delivers comprehensive end-to-end solutions in the Americas (\"AMER\"), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (\"EMEA\") and Asia-Pacific (\"APAC\") regions for our customers.  We specialize in working in industries with highly complex products and demanding regulatory requirements. Plexus has partnerships with approximately 140 customers in the Healthcare/Life Sciences, Industrial/Commercial, Communications, and Aerospace/Defense market sectors. We leverage our expertise to understand the unique needs of our customers\\' markets and have aligned our processes to provide flexibility, create efficiency and deliver superior quality. Our customers have stringent quality, reliability and regulatory requirements, requiring exceptional production and supply chain agility. Their products require complex configuration management, direct order fulfillment (to end customers), global logistics management and aftermarket services. To service the complexities that our customers\\' products demand, we utilize our full suite of solution offerings to support our customers\\' products from concept to end of life.  Plexus is passionate about being the leading EMS company in the world at servicing mid-to-low volume, higher complexity customer programs, characterized by unique flexibility, technology, quality and regulatory requirements. A high performance, accountable organization with a talented workforce that is deeply passionate about driving growth through customer service excellence; • Strategic growth by using customer driven, sector based go-to-market strategies; and •  Execution driven by a collaborative, customer centric culture that continuously evaluates and optimizes our business processes to strive to create shareholder value.  We operate flexible manufacturing facilities and design our processes to accommodate customers with multiple product lines and configurations. One or more uniquely configured \"focus factories,\" supported by a tailored supply chain and logistics solution, are designed to meet the flexibility and responsiveness needed to support customer fulfillment requirements.  Each sector has a market sector vice president and a business development and customer management leader who together oversee and provide leadership to teams that include business development directors, customer directors or managers, supply chain and manufacturing subject matter experts, and market sector analysts. These teams maintain expertise related to each market sector and execute sector strategies aligned to that market\\'s unique quality and regulatory requirements.  Our market sector teams help define Plexus\\' strategy for growth with a particular emphasis on expanding the value-added solutions we offer customers. Our primary focus is to earn a return on invested capital (\"ROIC\") Plexus measures economic profit by taking the difference between ROIC and WACC and multiplying it by invested capital. 4 Relative to our competition, overriding factors such as lower manufacturing volumes, flexibility and fulfillment requirements, and complex regulatory requirements typically result in higher investments in inventory and selling and administrative costs for us. The cost variance from our competitors is especially evident relative to those that provide EMS services for high-volume, less complex products, with less stringent requirements (e.g., consumer electronics).  Plexus serves a diverse customer landscape that includes industry-leading, branded product companies, along with many other technology pioneering start-ups or emerging companies that may or may not maintain manufacturing capabilities. As a result of serving market sectors that rely on advanced electronics technology, our business is influenced by critical technological trends such as the level and rate of development of wired and wireless telecommunications infrastructure, communications data and data bandwidth growth, and internet usage.\\nIs this bill potentially relevant to the company?

      "Company business description: We are guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, and content creators. In addition, we provide services, such as advertising.  We serve consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We design our stores to enable hundreds of millions of unique products to be sold by us and by third parties across dozens of product categories. Customers access our offerings through our websites, mobile apps, Alexa, and physically visiting our stores. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices, including Kindle e-readers, Fire tablets, Fire TVs, and Echo devices, and we develop and produce media content. In addition, we offer Amazon Prime, a membership program that includes unlimited free shipping on over 100 million items, access to unlimited streaming of thousands of movies and TV episodes, and other benefits.  We fulfill customer orders in a number of ways, including through: North America and International fulfillment and delivery networks that we operate; co-sourced and outsourced arrangements in certain countries; digital delivery; and through our physical stores. We offer programs that enable sellers to grow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders through us. We earn fixed fees, a percentage of sales, per-unit activity fees, interest, or some combination thereof, for our seller programs.  We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes, including start-ups, government agencies, and academic institutions, through our AWS segment, which offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings.  We serve authors and independent publishers with Kindle Direct Publishing, an online service that lets independent authors and publishers choose a royalty option and make their books available in the Kindle Store, along with Amazon's own publishing arm, Amazon Publishing. We also offer programs that allow authors, musicians, filmmakers, skill and app developers, and others to publish and sell content.  Our businesses encompass a large variety of product types, service offerings, and delivery channels. The worldwide marketplace in which we compete is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from many different industry sectors around the world. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our retail businesses include selection, price, and convenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment. Additional competitive factors for our seller and enterprise services include the quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers' ability and willingness to change business practices. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictive distribution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictive terms, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. Fourth quarter 2017 results include revenue attributable to Whole Foods Market, which we acquired on August 28, 2017.  Competition for qualified personnel in our industry has historically been intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff. \n",
